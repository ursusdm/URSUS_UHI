**URSUS_UHI** is a tool for the **automatic detection of unfavourable areas due to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect**. 

The tool is very simple to use and consists of the following steps.

  1. **Download** a **Landsat-8 image** of the city of interest
  2. **Run URSUS_UHI software** to **process** the image to detect unfavourable areas

      2.1 **Install / Run** URSUS_UHI software
  
      2.2. **Load** the image and **crop the area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest** interactively on the map

      2.3. **Show results**


## Download a Landsat-8 image of the city of interest

To download Landsat-8 images of the cities of interest for the study, we can do so free of charge from the site  https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov . It is necessary to be registered on this site in order to download the images.

The following screenshots show the process in detail: 

### Select the city of interest for the study (Search Criteria tab)

Define a criterion to filter the city of interest. There are different alternatives, for example:

  1. If it is the capital of a country or first-order administrative division. The "Feature (GNIS)" geocoding method can be used. Here, the "Feature Name" and "Country" are defined (or "State" if US features are used). For example, if we are interested in Madrid, the capital of Spain we will get
   <img width="300" alt="Select the city of study interest (1): Madrid" src="https://github.com/ursusdm/URSUS_UHI/assets/68539118/88bfab5f-0eaa-48df-9270-beee435b553d">

 2. If it is not listed with the "Feature (GNIS) geocoding method", the "Address/place" can be used. For example, if we are interested in Malaga, the capital of one Spanish province we will get
   <img width="300" alt="Select the city of study interest (1): Malaga" src="https://github.com/ursusdm/URSUS_UHI/assets/33939770/e10500b0-d082-41bb-8d0a-b80d5156d0c0">


Then, select the most appropriate element and press the "Show" button. A map with the selected item is then displayed.

The rest of the examples in this manual will use Malaga as the city of interest.

### Select satellite image type: LANDSAT-8 (Data Sets tab)

Search for Landsat-8 image and press the "Results" button

### Select the image that most suits your needs and download it

Each image has a list of buttons to interact with it. Click on the "Download" button for that image (green arrow going down to a hard disk).

Click in the "Products options" button

And download the first file (1 GB aprox.). It may be necessary to allow pop-up windows

  <img width="500" alt="Download file" src="https://github.com/ursusdm/URSUS_UHI/assets/33939770/ef13bda8-2214-4eb1-a68d-37991ecea9d6">

After this process, the data of the city of interest is ready to be processed by the URSUS-UHI software.

> [!NOTE]  
> All downloaded images must be placed unzipped in the data folder of the project.

## Run URSUS_UHI software to process the image to detect unfavourable areas

### Requirements

- R 4.3.1 or latest version
- RStudio
- Some R libraries (renv, shiny, dplyr, ...)

### Install / Run URSUS_UHI software
  
- **Clone the repository.** Open your terminal on your local machine and clone the repository

      git clone "https://github.com/ursusdm/URSUS_UHI.git"

- **Open R project file** placed in the folder
  
  <img width="121" alt="R file" src="https://github.com/ursusdm/URSUS_UHI/assets/68539118/27ed6bd7-fa32-4dee-8b95-09f2b65b5958">

- **Install / use renv package**. This package helps you to create reproducible environments for your R projects.

  Use the terminal inside RStudio to install the renv package.

      install.packages("renv")
 
  Download dependencies and libraries using renv:  

      renv::init()

  Select yes (if this is the first time renv is used) and select "Selection 1" to use exactly the same libraries that the application uses in its RStudio environment project.

  <img width="500" alt="renv library" src="https://github.com/ursusdm/URSUS_UHI/assets/68539118/fd47d9ee-1338-419e-bdff-cd197c44e1d5">

  If a package is not installed, you can try to install it manually.
  
      install.packages("libraryName")

  The required library packages are listed in the app.R file where there is code to automatically load such libraries.

### Crop the area of interest over the map
The red rectangle, sometimes visible, is the area covered by the selected landsat-8 image, a very large area.

Move on the map, zooming in and out, and find the area of interest.

Use the icon with a black square to define this area. It is marked in the map by a blue rectangle.
